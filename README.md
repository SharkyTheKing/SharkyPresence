# SharkyPresence
A project I decided to take up on after finding out about [PyPresence](https://github.com/qwertyquerty/pypresence). Know that this is a massive work in progress code. All rights for the Library belongs to [PyPresence](https://github.com/qwertyquerty/pypresence).

Due to this still being a work in progress, as of right now, I will not write anything for help on how to use this program as I have a ton of plan for the future for this.
